QUESTIONS

KPIs
1.	What is the total revenue?
2.	What is the total orders
3.	What is the total sales
4.	What is the average number of pizzas ordered


- Get the trends (hourly, daily, monthly) of important KPIs
- Information about categories and sizes of pizzas 
- What pizzas are the most and least ordered in the restaurant.

INSIGHTS
The pizza size and categories provide some information on the preference of customers, with classic pizzas the most ordered. Large pizzas are the most ordered an sold with Extra large contributing a very little amount of orders/sales, and thus having this in the menu proves to provide very little value for money.

Peak time of sales is between noon and 1:00pm (lunch) and then 4:00 â€“ 7:00pm (close of work), and thus having more employees around these peak times to process orders and make pizzas can make the restaurant more efficient.

Based on daily trends, most sales come between Thursday and Saturday, with sales peaking on Friday. The monthly trend observed in the data could help in making plans for the following year, matching the workforce with months with increased demand for pizzas.
